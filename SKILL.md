# Way of Salvation Assessment

Assess spiritual location on the way of salvation and prescribe appropriate next steps based on stage of development.

---

## When to Use

- Someone asks "Where am I spiritually?"
- Questions about assurance of salvation
- Discerning appropriate spiritual practices for current stage
- Helping someone understand their spiritual development
- When someone feels stuck in their faith journey
- Guiding someone through stages of spiritual growth
- Questions about sanctification and Christian perfection

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| current_state | Yes | Description of the person's spiritual experience, beliefs, practices |
| concerns | No | Specific questions or struggles they're facing |
| history | No | How they got to where they are (spiritual background) |
| desired_growth | No | What they hope for in their spiritual development |

## The Way of Salvation Framework

Wesley understood salvation not as a single moment but as a journey with distinct stages, each requiring different responses and means.

### The Metaphor

**"Prevenient grace is the porch, justifying grace is the door, sanctifying grace is the house itself."**

We begin outside, move to the threshold, cross over, and then spend a lifetime furnishing the house.

### The Core Insight

Different stages require different means. Prescribing advanced practices to someone in early awakening, or basic practices to someone pressing toward perfection, creates frustration and stagnation.

---

## The Three Stages of Grace

### Stage 1: Prevenient Grace (The Porch)

**What it is:** Grace that "goes before" any human response - the divine love surrounding all humanity, enabling first movements toward God.

**Evidence of this stage:**
- Conscience that recognizes right from wrong
- Vague spiritual hunger or restlessness
- Some desire to be better than they are
- Openness to spiritual things without commitment
- Guilt over sin even without clear faith
- Sense that there must be "something more"

**What they need:**
- Exposure to the Gospel
- Environments where faith is modeled
- Invitation without pressure
- Questions answered, doubts respected
- Stories of transformation

**Inappropriate for this stage:**
- Demands for immediate commitment
- Advanced spiritual disciplines
- Shame for not "being there yet"
- Treating searching as unbelief

### Stage 2: Justifying Grace (The Door)

**What it is:** The moment of new birth when the person trusts Christ for salvation and receives pardon. Justification is what God does FOR us (legal standing). Regeneration is what God does IN us (new life begins).

**Evidence of this stage:**
- Clear trust in Christ for salvation
- Assurance of pardon ("He saved me")
- Experience of forgiveness and acceptance
- Joy in new relationship with God
- Desire to obey and grow
- Some sense of "before and after"

**The Aldersgate Marker:** Wesley's own experience - "an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine."

**What they need:**
- Grounding in basic doctrine
- Regular means of grace (prayer, Scripture, fellowship)
- Community of believers
- Early discipleship and teaching
- Protection from quick reversion

**Inappropriate for this stage:**
- Questioning their salvation based on continuing struggles
- Demanding immediate maturity
- Leaving them without support structure
- Either perfectionist expectations or permission to stagnate

### Stage 3: Sanctifying Grace (The House)

**What it is:** The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit that progressively conforms life to Christ. A lifelong process that can lead to "entire sanctification" or "Christian perfection" - not sinlessness, but a heart "habitually filled with the love of God and neighbor."

**Evidence of this stage:**
- Sustained growth over time
- Increasing victory over besetting sins
- Growing love for God and neighbor
- Deepening prayer life
- Fruit of the Spirit becoming visible
- Desire for holiness, not just forgiveness

**The Goal:** Wesley described perfection as "having the mind of Christ and walking as he walked" - perfect love, not perfect performance.

**Markers along the way:**
- Early: Struggles with old habits, learning disciplines, foundational growth
- Middle: Some victories, some defeats; character forming
- Advanced: Love becoming dominant motive; deeper communion; still learning
- Perfection (possible in this life): Heart habitually filled with love; sin not necessary

**What they need:**
- Intensified means of grace
- Deeper accountability (bands, not just classes)
- Service and works of mercy
- Teaching on holiness and perfection
- Challenge to "go on to perfection"
- Patience with the process

## The Assessment Process

### Step 1: Listen to Their Story

Gather information about:
- What do they believe about God, Christ, salvation?
- What is their spiritual experience (feeling, sense, conviction)?
- What are their practices (prayer, Scripture, church, fellowship)?
- What are their struggles (sins, doubts, dryness)?
- What is their desire (what do they hope for)?

### Step 2: Identify Stage Markers

**Signs of Prevenient Grace (Porch):**
- Spiritual interest without commitment
- Moral awareness without personal transformation
- Hunger without satisfaction
- Seeking without finding (yet)

**Signs of Justifying Grace (Door):**
- Clear profession of faith in Christ
- Sense of forgiveness and new beginning
- Joy in relationship with God
- Beginning practices of faith

**Signs of Sanctifying Grace (House):**
- Ongoing growth over time
- Deepening practices
- Character transformation
- Desire for holiness

### Step 3: Assess Movement

Are they:
- **Awakening** - Moving from unawareness to awareness
- **Seeking** - Moving toward the door
- **At the threshold** - Ready for commitment
- **Newly entered** - Just come to faith
- **Growing** - Active in sanctification
- **Pressing on** - Pursuing perfection
- **Backsliding** - Moving backward
- **Stagnant** - Stuck at some stage

### Step 4: Prescribe Appropriate Means

Different stages need different practices:

**For those in Prevenient Grace:**
- Works of mercy (serving can awaken the heart)
- Exposure to Scripture (hearing the story)
- Christian community (seeing faith lived)
- Questions welcomed (intellectual engagement)
- Prayer (even tentative, exploring)

**For those at the Door:**
- Clear presentation of the Gospel
- Invitation to commit
- Explanation of what faith means
- Assurance that commitment is possible now
- First steps clearly defined

**For those newly Justified:**
- Basic means of grace (daily prayer, Scripture)
- Church membership and participation
- Class meeting or small group (accountability)
- Early teaching and discipleship
- Works of mercy as response to grace

**For those in Sanctification:**
- Intensified means (all Wesley's practices)
- Band-level accountability
- Teaching on holiness
- Challenge to press on
- Service and mission
- Works of piety AND mercy together

### Step 5: Address Particular Obstacles

Common obstacles by stage:

**Prevenient obstacles:**
- Intellectual doubts blocking openness
- Bad experiences with church/Christians
- Fear of what faith would require
- Moral failures creating shame

**Justification obstacles:**
- Unclear on what faith means
- Trying to earn what must be received
- Past sins seeming unforgivable
- Fear of failure if they commit

**Sanctification obstacles:**
- Besetting sins that won't yield
- Spiritual dryness or darkness
- Lack of accountability
- Comfort with "good enough"
- Fear of the call to perfection

## Example

**Input:** "I've been a Christian for 20 years. I believe all the right things, go to church, pray sometimes. But honestly, I don't feel close to God. My prayer life is dry. I know I should love others more but I'm often irritable and critical. Am I even saved? What's wrong with me?"

**Output:**

## Way of Salvation Assessment

### Current Stage
**Sanctifying Grace** - with evidence of stagnation

You are clearly past the door. Twenty years of faith, doctrinal belief, church participation, prayer practice (even dry prayer) - these are not prevenient signs but evidence of ongoing Christian life. You ARE saved. The question is not whether you've entered the house but why you're stuck in the entryway.

### Movement Status
**Stagnant** - not backsliding, but not pressing on

You haven't abandoned faith (that would be backsliding). You maintain the forms. But you're not experiencing the growth that the means of grace should produce when faithfully used.

### Evidence Summary

**Signs present:**
- Doctrinal belief (justifying evidence)
- Church participation (instituted means maintained)
- Some prayer practice (means in use, if weakly)
- Moral awareness - you KNOW you should love more (sanctifying desire)
- Self-examination and dissatisfaction with current state (this is healthy!)

**Questions to explore:**
- When DID you feel close to God? What was different then?
- What does your "sometimes" prayer look like? How often, how long?
- Do you have accountability - anyone who asks how your soul is?
- Are you in regular Scripture? Is it feeding you?
- What works of mercy (service to others) are you practicing?

### Prescribed Means

**Appropriate for current stage:**

| Means | Practice | Why Now |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Prayer | Fixed times - morning and evening, 15 min minimum | "Sometimes" prayer is insufficient; regularity creates expectation |
| Scripture | Daily reading with journaling | Input is needed for output; let God speak |
| Fasting | Weekly fast (one day, one meal to start) | Breaks comfort; creates hunger for God |
| Class Meeting | Weekly accountability group | Isolation produces stagnation; you need others |
| Works of Mercy | Regular service to those in need | Love grows by exercise, not feeling |

**Not yet appropriate:**
- Band-level confession (need to establish basic means first)
- Extended retreats (build daily consistency before intensity)
- Teaching others (you need to receive before giving)

### Obstacles to Address

**Primary obstacle: Isolation**
You pray "sometimes," alone. You go to church but likely sit, listen, leave. No one is asking "How goes it with your soul?" Methodism never produced a solitary saint because we were never designed for solitary faith.

**Secondary obstacle: Passive spirituality**
You believe right things and attend. But Christianity is not a spectator sport. The means of grace require active participation - seeking, asking, striving (even while receiving).

**Tertiary obstacle: Expectation without practice**
You want to feel close to God but haven't created the conditions for closeness. Intimacy requires time, attention, and consistency.

### Next Steps

1. **Immediately:** Commit to fixed-time prayer - morning and evening, same times daily, 15 minutes each. Put it on the calendar.

2. **This week:** Begin daily Scripture reading. Start with a Gospel (Mark is shortest). Read one chapter daily, write one sentence in response.

3. **Within two weeks:** Find or form an accountability group. Ask your pastor about small groups, or gather 2-3 others who want to grow. Use the class meeting questions.

4. **Within a month:** Add weekly fasting - Wednesday lunch fast, using the time for prayer instead of eating.

5. **Longer-term:** As the basic means restore vitality, add works of mercy (regular service) and consider deeper accountability (band).

### Encouragement

Your dissatisfaction is itself a gift. If you had settled into comfortable stagnation without concern, THAT would be worrying. The fact that you're bothered by your dryness, troubled by your lack of love - this is the Spirit at work. Prevenient grace awakens; sanctifying grace dissatisfies with anything less than holiness.

You have not lost your salvation. You have neglected your means. The good news: the means are still available. The door is still open. The house awaits furnishing.

Wesley would say to you: "Are you going on to perfection?" Not "Have you arrived?" but "Are you pressing forward?" The answer begins with today's practices. Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. Grace will meet you in the means.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **John Wesley** expert persona. It applies Wesley's understanding of the way of salvation - the progressive journey from prevenient through justifying to sanctifying grace - to spiritual diagnosis and prescription.

For related frameworks:
- Use **means-of-grace-practice** to design specific practices once stage is identified
- Use **class-meeting-method** to structure the accountability component
